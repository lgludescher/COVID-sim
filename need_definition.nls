;;survival needs differ from safety in that they are related to the urgency of physiological risk where safety is rather a matter of general anxiety


;;I set food safety need satisfaction with a "min" operator as it tends to override other needs
;;risk avoidance might be a second option. Though, risk-compliance makes it for a poor proxy; as "safety = risk-avoidance"
;;a more specific concept would be appropriate (e.g. "contagion-safety" for instance, I let you adapt depending on what you want to represent with this variable).
